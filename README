NAME

    warnings::compat - warnings.pm emulation for pre-5.6 Perls


DESCRIPTION

    This is a module to help writing portable programs and modules across
    recent and old versions of Perl by providing a unique API to enable and
    disable warnings. Under the hood, it will use the real warnings.pm
    module when available, or install and use an emulation compatible with
    Perl 5.000. Therefore, "use warnings::compat" should do the right thing
    on every Perl version.

        perl Makefile.PL

    following commands:
