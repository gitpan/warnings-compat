NAME

    warnings - warnings.pm emulation for pre-5.6 Perls


DESCRIPTION

    This module is a very simple "warnings.pm" emulation for Perls before
    5.6. Its aim is to allow programs that uses this pragma to compile and
    run under old Perls by providing an API emulation, i.e. the functions
    work the same, but will not behave exactly like the real module. Under
    the hood, this module simply uses $^W.
